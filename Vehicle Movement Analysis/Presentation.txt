PROBLEM STATEMENT - Vehicle movement analysis and insight generation in a college campus using edge ai 

PROCESS SOLUTION-

Created a project for vehicle movement analysis and insight generation in a college campus used edge AI involves several steps, including hardware setup, software development, and integration. Below is the description


Hardware Requirements:

1.Edge Device: Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson Nano

2.Camera: USB or CSI camera compatible with the edge device


Software Requirements:

1.Operating System: Raspberry Pi OS or JetPack for NVIDIA Jetson

2.Programming Languages: Python for development

3.Libraries: OpenCV for image processing, TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models


Project Outline:

1.Vehicle Detection: Used a pre-trained deep learning model (such as YOLO or SSD) for real-time vehicle detection from camera feed.

2.Object Tracking: Implemented object tracking (like SORT or Deep SORT) to track vehicles across frames, providing movement paths and speeds.

3.Data Collection: Store relevant data such as vehicle count, movement patterns, and timestamps in a database (SQLite or MySQL).

3.Insight Generation: Analyze collected data to generate insights such as peak traffic times, common routes, and parking patterns.
